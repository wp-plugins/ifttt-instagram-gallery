IFTTT Instagram Gallery is a highly configurable plugin that automatically shares your Instagram pictures in an amazing looking photo grid.

== Description ==

IFTTT Instagram Gallery is a highly configurable plugin that will showcase your Instagram photos in an awesome tile pattern on your WordPress blog.

Whenever you add a new photo to your Instagram feed, it will automatically appear on your WordPress blog.

* Full control over image sizes
* Fast load times
* Highly customizable gallery layout
* Ability to define number of images and rows
* Option to randomise order of Instagram images
* Link to original Instagram images
* Images are stored locally in your WordPress Media Library
* Fully responsive

*What is IFTTT?*

[IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com/), which stands for "If This Then That", is a service that enables users to connect web applications like Instagram and WordPress together through simple conditional statements known as "Recipes". There is a public recipe to be used in combination with this plugin:
